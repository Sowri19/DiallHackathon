Therapist: I see. What has been on your mind lately that's been causing you to feel overwhelmed?
Patient: Well, work has been really stressful lately. I feel like I have too much on my plate.
Therapist: It sounds like work is taking a toll on you. Have you been able to take any breaks or practice self-care?
